This project aims to analyze and visualize correlations between different features in a movie dataset. It explores which factors (like budget, runtime, score, etc.) are most strongly correlated with the revenue a movie generates.

## Objective
To identify relationships between key variables in a movie dataset to gain insights that can help in understanding what influences a movieâ€™s success.

## Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used is a CSV file containing details of various movies such as:

Budget
Gross earnings
Company
Runtime
Score
Genre
Votes
Year Released

## Key Steps in the Project

## Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates
Converted data types (e.g., budget, gross)
Handled missing values

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Correlation heatmaps
Scatter plots to visualize relationships
Grouped analysis (e.g., company vs. revenue)

## Correlation Techniques
Pearson Correlation
Spearman Correlation
Numerical encoding for categorical features to include them in correlation analysis

## Insights
Found strong correlation between votes and gross revenue.
A positive relationship exists between budget and gross.
Surprisingly, company and genre showed low correlation with revenue.
