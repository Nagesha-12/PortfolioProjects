# Zomato SQL Analytics Case Study

This project demonstrates real-world SQL analytics using simulated transactional data from a fictional food delivery platform, **Zomato**. It includes customer signups, sales history, product catalog, and premium (gold) membership data.

## Project Overview

The goal is to solve key business and customer-related analytical queries using SQL. This is useful for preparing for SQL interviews, practicing advanced queries, or understanding how data-driven decision-making works in a food-tech company.

## Dataset Structure

Four tables are created and populated with mock data:

- **users**: Stores user signup dates.
- **goldusers_signup**: Tracks when users joined the Zomato Gold program.
- **sales**: Transaction data including user, product purchased, and date.
- **product**: Product catalog with prices.

## SQL Business Questions Solved

1. **Total amount each customer spent on Zomato**
2. **Number of distinct days each customer visited**
3. **First product purchased by each customer**
4. **Most purchased item overall**
5. **Most frequently purchased item by each customer**
6. **First item bought after becoming a Gold member**
7. **Item purchased just before becoming a Gold member**
8. **Total orders and amount spent before Gold membership**
9. **Points collected by each customer based on custom loyalty rules**
10. **Points earned in the first year of Gold membership**
11. **Rank of all transactions by customer**
12. **Rank of all transactions during Gold membership; mark non-membership as 'na'**

## SQL Features Used

- `JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY...)`
- `CASE WHEN` and custom logic for rewards
- `DATEADD`, `CAST`
